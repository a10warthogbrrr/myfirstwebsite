        <p class="inutext"> In the prefecture of Fukuoka, there was a Tunnel, built in the year 1949. It led to the Village of Inunaki, where there was a sign in the entrance that read “The Japanese Constitution is not in effect past this point”, as the residents refused to obey the constitution, creating their no-law territory where anything could be possible without consequences. It is said that many crimes were committed both in the tunnel and near it. Due to the poor maintenance of the Old Tunnel, many people died or ended up lost in the village without means to contact the outside world. In 1975 a New Tunnel was built, but it didnt put an end to these horrific crimes as in 1988 a factory worker was killed by five boys who wanted to steal his car. The Old Tunnels location is kind of unknown, as there was no maintenance and after being closed it ended up disappearing into the wild and vegetation. The New Tunnel is sealed by concrete blocks and cant be trespassed. It is a popular location for those who want to risk it.</p>
