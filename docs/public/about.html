            Hello Im Sonsoles and I am currently a 1st year Computer Science student at University Francisco de Vitoria. I used to study Biotechnology in this same University, but I switched careers, not because I didnt like the previous one, but because I felt my hobbies and goals were more aligned towards my current field. Im a big fan of solving puzzles and mysteries, so the internet, due to the huge quantity of information it possesses, has been a really interesting place for me to wander around. All kinds of people surf the internet and many things are going on at once. There are many secrets hidden online, and internet privacy and digital footprint are unknown concepts to many. I find cybersecurity to be really interesting and vital in todays society. Computer Forensics is also a field im interested in, as many crimes are commited online and the information exists there somewhere, waiting to be retrieved and analised.</p>
